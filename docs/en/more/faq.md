### Do I need a SEGA ID?

Yes, to use most features you need:
- A SEGA ID account
- Access to maimai NET (online score tracking)
- Binding your account to the bot

See [Account Binding](/en/guide/binding) for setup instructions.

## Account Binding

### How do I bind my SEGA ID?

1. Send `bind` to the bot
2. Click the binding URL button
3. Enter your SEGA ID and password on the web form
4. Select your server version
5. Confirm binding

**Important**: Do NOT type your credentials in the chat. Binding is web-based only.

See [Account Binding Guide](/en/guide/binding) for details.

### Can I type my SEGA credentials in the chat?

**No.** For security reasons, JiETNG uses web-based binding only. Never type your password in the chat.

### The binding link expired. What do I do?

Binding tokens expire after **2 minutes**. Simply send `bind` again to get a new link.

## Using Features

### How do I generate my Best 50?

Send one of these commands:
- `b50`
- `best50`

Bind your SEGA ID before using `b50` and similar commands.

See [Score Commands](/en/commands/record) for details.

### How often should I update my scores?

Update after each play session:
```
maimai update
```

This fetches your latest scores from maimai NET.

### How long does score update take?

Usually 2 to 3 seconds, depending on:
- Number of songs you've played
- SEGA server response time
- Queue wait time (if many users are updating)

### Why isn't my latest score showing?

1. **Did you update?** Run `maimai update` first
2. **Check maimai NET**: Is your score on the official site?
3. **Wait time**: Scores may take a few minutes to appear on maimai NET
4. **Network issues**: SEGA servers may be slow

## Features and Commands

## Troubleshooting

### "You haven't bound your SEGA ID yet"

**Solution**: Bind your account with `bind` command.

### "Failed to update scores"

**Possible causes:**

**Solutions:**
